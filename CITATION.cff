abstract: >-
  pylir is an optimizing ahead-of-time compiler for python.
  The goal of the project is to compile python code to
  native executables that run as fast as possible through
  the use of optimizations. Despite being ahead-of-time, the
  goal is to achieve as high of language conformance as is
  possible and reasonable.
